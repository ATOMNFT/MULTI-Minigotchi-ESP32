#### DO NOT INSTALL ANY OF THE FILES ONTO THE PICO!
I am going to make some major changes to this repo soon. The fact that everything is written in lua and requires more space to do makes this so much harder than it needs to be. I am going to find some other firmware and modules, then use python instead. The branch called "saved" is an archive of the work in lua, although it will not work.

#### Note
The pico itself doesn't really have a hard disk. The "disk" that gets mounted on your computer is just a dummy. Whatever you put on there will be copied to the actual memory/ram.
