#### DO NOT INSTALL ANY OF THE FILES ONTO THE PICO!
Mostly just figuring out C++ and C, that allows the raw frames to be sent. Long story short I may need to learn C++ and C, and at least just figuring out variables. The branch called "saved" is an archive of the work in python, using the esp8266 wrapper, although it will not work, since I have not made the progress in defining the headers being sent to the pwnagotchi.

#### Note
The pico itself doesn't really have a hard disk. The "disk" that gets mounted on your computer is just a dummy. Whatever you put on there will be copied to the actual memory/ram.
