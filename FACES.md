# Faces
The minigotchi has multiple faces, similar to that of the pwnagotchi.I tried my best here to adhere to how emotions were handled with the pwnagotchi

### (^-^) Happy
- found a pwnagotchi

### (;-;) Sad
- can't find a pwnagotchi
- can't find any AP's

### (X-X) Broken
- error while the program was running has occured
- usually an error will be provided, or it will literally tell you what the issue is

### (>-<) Intense
- sending frames to an AP
- sending json packet
- doing any task of some sort that may require resources

### (0-o) (o-0) Looking around
- looking for a pwnagotchi, scanning for AP's

### ('-') Neutral
- normal face on startup
- may have something to say

### (-.-) Sleeping
- switching channel
