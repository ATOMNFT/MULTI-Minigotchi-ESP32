# Faces
The minigotchi has multiple faces, similar to that of the pwnagotchi. I tried my best here to adhere to how emotions were handled with the pwnagotchi. It doesn't exactly have an emotion set using a setting, rather having the emotion being shown to the user. It might be best to have the emotion set to a variable, although this will be done later. 

**Note that these are the only emotions that the minigotchi is capable of showing. You may add your own but at this moment the last release doesn't have any emotions.**

### (^-^) Happy

- can say the stats while happy

### (;-;) Sad
- can't find a pwnagotchi
- can't find any AP's

### (X-X) Broken
- error while the program was running has occured
- usually an error will be provided, or it will literally tell you what the issue is

### (>-<) Intense

- doing any task of some sort that may require resources

### (0-o) (o-0) Looking around
- looking for a pwnagotchi, scanning for AP's
