# minigotchi
###
### an even smaller pwnagotchi.
###
#### Intro
Overall, this project started as a thought. A pwnagotchi on a raspberry pi pico. Crazy, right? Anyway, this project may make it a little bit more possible. Instead of pwning, it will be a friend to a local pwnagotchi(Most likely one of yours).
####
### Prerequisites
- Raspberry pi pico (not the pico w, no support for it YET.)
- Esp8266 wifi adapter (or any supported by the firmware)
- Breadboard
- A supported IDE
- A seperate computer capable of transferring files
- Internet connection
###
### How it operates/works
###
The minigotchi relies on the IDE connected to the pico. The pico will attempt to associate to a local access point, then send packets through that network on a random channel. The logs will be put through the IDE(preferably thonny in this case).
###
### To do
- Get hardware(esp8266, maybe breadboard?)
- LEARN LUA ASAP!!!!
